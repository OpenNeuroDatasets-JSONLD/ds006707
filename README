# Night Owls Scan Club (NOSC)

Data repository for the Night Owls Scan Club (NOSC) Project under Temple University IRB #24452. Github repository for preprocessing and analysis code can be found at https://github.com/DVS-Lab/night-owls

## Description
NOSC is a multiband, multi-echo, intensively sampled fMRI study of the reward response. It is described in detail in Mattoni et al., 2025 (preprint to be posted). Briefly, participants each provided 9-12 sessions (44 total) of functional data at a roughly biweekly rate. Each session consisteed of two runs of the MID task and two runs of the Shared Reward task, a social reward task. Participants completed a positive mood induction task in between runs and provided a mood rating before each run. Partiicpants also provided PANAS ratings and alertness scores. Resting state was collected in odd numbered sessions and neuromelanin scans (not yet included in this release) were collected in even numbered scans. 

Please note that BIDS validator warnings are in large part attributed to additional filenaming structures (part-mag/part-phase), as well as JSON sidecar headers that are not available in the .dcm files output by our Siemens 3T Prisma Scanner. We would like to note that these warnings do not reflect data or organization errors, nor prevent preprocessing or analyses. Please see this GitHub issue for more information on extraneous JSON headers: https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/2040
